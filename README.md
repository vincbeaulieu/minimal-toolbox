# minimal-toolbox
A simple toolbox of functions that I often use in many projects.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/vincbeaulieu/minimal-toolbox.git  
```

Import does not work yet using the "pip install ..." method.
Workaround: Simply install the toolbox.py file in your workspace to use it.
