# minimal-toolbox  
A simple toolbox of functions that I often use in many projects.  
  
```
pip install git+https://github.com/vincbeaulieu/minimal-toolbox.git  
```
  
**Import does not work using the "pip install" method, yet...**  
## Workaround:  
Simply install the toolbox.py file in your workspace to use it.
